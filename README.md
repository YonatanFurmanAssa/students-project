# students-project
hello students, hope u all r doing fine, anyways, i created this project which summarizes almost everything u need to know, dont hesitate to add new things to the project/ask me anything

so, the project itself is a classic server client architecture, which includes the next arc:
db -> backend -> frontend -> user

that's all for now, the other arc of the devops part will be provided in a drawio format

the backend is written in js with node.js as the frame work, frontend react with node.js and nginx, all u need to add in the development part is as follows: 
.env files for both backend and frontend, and of course remember to do npm i to add the node_modules i deleted, those are esstntial in order to get the node app going 

in terms of real devops, u will need to configure and create a new db, in postgresql db, which within u will need to configure postgresql.conf file that will work with minikube as a host there 
and in hba conf as well change the secuirity measurment, in case u dont understand what i wrote please talk to me or to an ai
